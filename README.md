## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Generate random advice when clicking the button

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Advice Generator](https://aphatheology.github.io/Advice_Generator_App)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Node Modules
- Advice API
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Effect of each method used. I used ::after to insert an Image in a div. The Advice to Image function won't include any content from ::after or ::before. I have to insert the image using <img />
- How to use Node Packages without installing them directly in the project using Skypack.dev


### Continued development

- Allow users to use their own text for the advice.
- Allow users to customize font-size, background-color and color (advice text).
